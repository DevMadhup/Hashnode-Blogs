Nowadays, Terraform is the most demanding tool in terms of DevOps.

So, let's discuss about some questions and concepts regarding terraform.

### What is Terraform and how can it help you manage infrastructure as code?

Terraform is an IAAC ( Infrastructure As A Code ) tool which used to build and change infrastructure.

It helps us to manage infrastructure as code in the following ways:

1) Scope - Identify the infrastructure for your project.

2) Author - Write the configuration for your infrastructure.

3) Initialize - Install the plugins Terraform needs to manage the infrastructure.

4) Plan - Preview the changes Terraform will make to match your configuration.

5) Apply - Make the planned changes.

### Why do we need Terraform and how does it simplify infrastructure provisioning?

Terraform helps to autmomate the infrastructure with the help of terraform configuration files.

It reduces :

i) cost

ii) human errors etc.

It makes infrastructure provisioning Simple and Fast. With a simple configuration file, we can manage multiple projects. Terraform increases the speed of creating infrastructure, and automation.

### How can you install Terraform and set up the environment for AWS, Azure, or GCP?

> Installation:

```plaintext
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
```

### Explain the important terminologies of Terraform with the example at least (5 crucial terminologies).

1) Provider -

A provider is a plugin that lets Terraform manage an external API.

---

2) Resource -

Resources are the most important element in the Terraform. Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records

---

3) Module -

A module is a collection of terraform configuration files in a directory.

---

4) Variable -

Variables in terraforms are used to store reusable values.

---

5) Output -

Terraform output helps to share data between Terraform configurations and with other tools and automation.

Congratulations, you are now able to move forward with advanced terraform.
